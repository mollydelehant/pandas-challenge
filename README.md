#Writing Analysis
1. Summarize the analysis: The analysis allows us to compare schools and draw conclusions based on student scores, number of students and budget.
2. Draw two correct comparisons or conclusions from the calculations:
      spending more on students did not improve scores
      generally, schools with less students had better average scores
